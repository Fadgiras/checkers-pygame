# checkers-pygame
## small english draughts python script 
### to run use $python3 try8.py 
the script requires pygame  
a game of checkers developped using pygame and basic python you can use as a small school project  
- You can drag and drop checkers prieces  
- When selecting a piece the position you can move to are highlighted in green (moves) or yellow (captures)
- the paths you can take when capturing pieces is drawn as tree
- the points and the move log are shown on the right
- you can start a new game 
- on the next update i will turn this game into a network game (i knwo using web tech is much easier but i'm doing this to learn python more)
- i will also try to implement an AI module to play against the computer, i am still reading on the subject 
- please note that i did not copy from another checkers game project and all the algorithms are mine 
- i would appreciate your comment and feedback at idriss.el.moussaouiti@gmail.com
